## Web application for Flood risk disaster risk mitigation

#### Background Information

There is a lot of work that has been done around modelling factors influencing vulnerability of households  to flood risk but none of the works(model results ) 
or recommendations are easily accessible to users/primary duty bearers . 
This project therefore aims towards bridging this gap of information access to targetted users by providing easy  to use and highly interactive 
interface/tool to intended users to be able to quickly ; 
• Assess the level of vulnearbility of households and therefore able to estimate population at risk of floods.
• In future the tool can be enhanced by triangulating it with other data sources such as level of  vulnerability to floods and risk of snake bites
(which currently is a grey research area /gap) 


#### Goal of the project (In development)
The project aims to create a web app for a model to predict vulnearbility of households to flood risks . 
The web app will be built using python Dash and plotly frameworks to provide an easy to use interface to  stakeholders . 
Currently there is very limited and interactive tools for predicting households vulnerability to floods



#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
Kilifi County government,NDMA and Local Community CBOs working on helping communities at risk of  floods

#### Expected Deliverables
1. Web application
- Exploratory data anlysis of social and economic factors for communities at risk of floods 
- Model to explain the contribution of the socio-economic factors to flood risk
- Plotly and Dash dashboard

#### Mentors (To be added by ABW Team)
